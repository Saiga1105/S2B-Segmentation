Segmentation MATLAB .NET Assembly (.NET Component)

1. Prerequisites for Deployment 

Verify that version 9.4 (R2018a) of the MATLAB Runtime is installed.   
If not, you can run the MATLAB Runtime installer.
To find its location, enter
  
    >>mcrinstaller
      
at the MATLAB prompt.
NOTE: You will need administrator rights to run the MATLAB Runtime installer. 

Alternatively, download and install the Windows version of the MATLAB Runtime for R2018a 
from the following link on the MathWorks website:

    http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html
   
For more information about the MATLAB Runtime and the MATLAB Runtime installer, see 
Package and Distribute in the MATLAB Compiler SDK documentation  
in the MathWorks Documentation Center.

2. Files to Deploy and Package

-Segmentation.dll
   -contains the generated component using MWArray API. 
-SegmentationNative.dll
   -contains the generated component using native API.
-This readme file
    Note: if end users are unable to download the MATLAB Runtime using the
    instructions in the previous section, include it when building your 
    component by clicking the "Runtime included in package" link in the
    Deployment Tool.


Auto-generated Documentation Templates:

MWArray.xml - This file contains the code comments for the MWArray data conversion 
              classes and their methods. This file can be found in either the component 
              distrib directory or in
              <mcr_root>*\toolbox\dotnetbuilder\bin\win64\v4.0

Segmentation_overview.html - HTML overview documentation file for the generated 
                             component. It contains the requirements for accessing the 
                             component and for generating arguments using the MWArray 
                             class hierarchy.

Segmentation.xml - This file contains the code comments for the Segmentation component 
                             classes and methods. Using a third party documentation tool, 
                             this file can be combined with either or both of the 
                             previous files to generate online documentation for the 
                             Segmentation component.
